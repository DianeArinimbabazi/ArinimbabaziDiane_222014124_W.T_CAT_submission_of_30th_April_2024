Project Description:
pharmacy management project, which integrates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a database to streamline pharmacy operations.

In this project, I've created a system that manages various aspects of the pharmacy, including suppliers, sales, medicines, inventory, and patients. To make this system more robust and dynamic, I've connected it to a database.

By connecting the project to a database, all the information entered into the system is stored and managed efficiently. This ensures that data is persistent and can be accessed anytime, even after the browser is closed.

For example, when a new supplier is added or a sale is made, the information is stored in the database. This allows for easy retrieval and analysis of data, such as generating reports on sales trends or monitoring inventory levels.

To connect the project to the database, I used technologies like PHP for server-side scripting and MySQL for the database management system. These technologies work seamlessly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a powerful and dynamic pharmacy management system.
